Hi, Iâ€™m Kyle Stewart  

After graduating with a degree in Biology from the University of North Texas I found myself lost and not knowing what I wanted to do. I soon developed a passion for coding and have recently graduated from [nucamp coding bootcamp](https://www.nucamp.co/), making me career ready and excited for the journey ahead.  

The projects uploaded here will include some that I've worked on as a part of the bootcamp, as well as individual projects.
